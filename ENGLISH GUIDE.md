1. First thing first, install the latest version of normal TaiChi!
2. Then open it, go into the About page, click retrieve ID code and copy the code
3. Follow gh_39c8fb2fc8b4 (虚拟框架) on WeChat and send your code. This process is **INSTANT**

[FAQ and some known issues](https://github.com/tiann/EXposed/wiki/%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E4%BA%8B%E9%A1%B9%E5%92%8C%E5%B7%B2%E7%9F%A5%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98)

**Which one should I use? 3.2-a or 3.2-b?**

Try 3.2-b *FIRST* and IF AND ONLY IF 3.2-b is stable, then try 3.2-a

3.2-b does not support Android patch and Edge gestures, try 3.2-a if needed. If hot reboot occurs when using 3.2-a then please switch to 3.2-b.

**Conflicts with other Magisk modules**

Magisk TaiChi is know to not work with the following: "Advanced Settings(高级设置)";"Magisk Hide Prop Config";"SafetyPatch"

**Current Magisk TaiChi may cause Riru modules to malfunction, please note.**

**Can I use with non Pie roms?**

Pie is preferred, anything below is not tested properly, so you must be cautious when using. Anything below 8.0 should not even attempt this AT ALL

**EMUI ?**

EMUI 9.0 with Kirin 980 may lead to bootloop, proceed with extreme caution.
